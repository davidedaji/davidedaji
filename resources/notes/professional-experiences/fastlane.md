As a Head of Research (Engineering-Driven), I set the research direction and ship production systems. The goal is to to deliver MEV-aware infrastructure across validator tooling, order flow auctions and monitoring systems. Main Fastlane's cutting-edge MEV solutions: MEV Client, LST, Atlas Framework (Sold to Chainlink 2026)

Highlights Include:
- Contributed to the launch of the FastLane MEV Protocol, built with Category Labs, described as a fully decentralized MEV auction design for Monad validators.

- Supported the team in launching ShMonad [https://shmonad.xyz/]. LST on Monad. Platform deposits to 331.2M, versus 47.9M, 12.5M, and 43M at three primary competitors, reaching ~10× the average peer and >3× their combined deposits in the first 2 weeks.

- Advanced Atlas to market readiness via profitability research, automated monitoring (SLA), and order flow auction dynamics analysis, ahead of the Jan 22, 2026 Chainlink acquisition announcement. Positioning Atlas to support Chainlink SVR going forward.

- Led the end-to-end build of the Points System backend, delivering real-time points computation for 200k addresses across 10 protocols with protocol-specific logic and 99.9% uptime, while also contributing to the design of the points mathematics and incentive model.

- Co-authored a research paper on improving execution quality in competitive, permissionless order flow auctions: “Using Failure Costs to Guarantee Execution Quality in Competitive and Permissionless Order Flow Auctions” (arXiv: 2503.05338)
