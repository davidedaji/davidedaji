I had the chance to work directly with a 5‑member team composed by senior software engineers, a senior trader (IMC) and former marketing and general managers. We closely worked together to build and run market making and arbitrage strategies in the cryptocurrency markets.

I designed, developed and operate the reporting tools that gave us the key performance metrics needed to understand the trading profitability. Remarkably, I was entirely responsible of the construction of an automated daily‑trading analysis (Python and SQL) capable of interacting with the blockchain (Web3) and producing daily/weekly reports.

In particular I was involved in:
• Designing new unhedged arbitrage strategies on Decentralized exchanges
• Analyzing markets and order books to spot profitable possibilities
• Computing daily Net Asset Value and daily trading positions
• Modelling automatic trading and performance metrics through Python (server)
• Deciding management and performing reporting ‑ with AGILE SCRUM framework
• Helping building the business being part of big family
